# Code Challenge Resolution

# SDET--SG

## Objective
We would like you complete the following code test in order to evaluate your automation skills.  Please place your code in a public Github repository so we can review it.

## Feature to Test

As a Customer we want to see if the second Iphone related ad from the second results page from www.aliexpress.com has at least 1 item to be bought.

## Show your work
1.  Create a Public repository
2.  Commit each step of your process so we can follow your thought process.

## Technologies
You can use any language of your choice, preferably JAVA or JS but is not restrictive, avoid the usage of "canned tools" such as Selenium IDE (not to be mistaken with Selenium WebDriver, you can use Selenium WebDriver), QTP, etc.

## Time Spent
We suggest not to spend more than 5 hours total, which can be done over the course of 2 days.  Please make commits as often as possible so we can see the time you spent and please do not make one commit.  We will evaluate the code and time spent.
 
What we want to see is how well you handle yourself given the time you spend on the problem, how you think, and how you prioritize when time is insufficient to solve everything.

Please email your solution as soon as you have completed the challenge or the time is up.
